# Multiple Response Issue Fix

## Problem Description

The user was experiencing Navi sending multiple responses to a single AKT price query, resulting in:
1. "The current AKT price is $1.15 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $5.25 million."
2. "I'm retrieving the latest AKT token information for you..."
3. "The current price of Akash Network (AKT) is $1.09 USD. The market cap is $294.61 million USD. The price has increased by 1.32% in the last 24 hours."

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **conflicting message examples** in the character configuration that triggered different response patterns for the same type of query:

1. **Duplicate AKT Price Examples**: Multiple message examples for AKT price queries were causing conflicts
2. **Mixed Action Types**: Some examples used `GET_TOKEN_INFO` while others used `WEB_SEARCH` for the same query types
3. **Multiple Response Paths**: Different examples were triggering simultaneously, causing multiple responses

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Consolidated Message Examples

**Before:**
```typescript
// Multiple conflicting examples for AKT price
[
  { name: "{{name1}}", content: { text: "what is the current price of AKT?" } },
  { name: "Navi", content: { text: "I'll get the current AKT token information for you!", action: "GET_TOKEN_INFO" } }
],
[
  { name: "{{name1}}", content: { text: "show me information about the Akash token" } },
  { name: "Navi", content: { text: "Let me retrieve the latest market data for the AKT token!", action: "GET_TOKEN_INFO" } }
],
[
  { name: "{{name1}}", content: { text: "what's the current akt price?" } },
  { name: "Navi", content: { actions: ["WEB_SEARCH"] } }
]
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Single consolidated example for AKT price
[
  { name: "{{name1}}", content: { text: "what is the current price of AKT?" } },
  { name: "Navi", content: { text: "I'll get the current AKT token information for you!", action: "GET_TOKEN_INFO" } }
],
[
  { name: "{{name1}}", content: { text: "what's the current akt price?" } },
  { name: "Navi", content: { text: "I'll get the current AKT token information for you!", action: "GET_TOKEN_INFO" } }
],
[
  { name: "{{name1}}", content: { text: "current akt trading volume" } },
  { name: "Navi", content: { text: "I'll get the current AKT token metrics including trading volume!", action: "GET_TOKEN_INFO" } }
]
```

### 2. Enhanced System Prompt

Added specific guidance for single response behavior:

```typescript
- PROVIDE only ONE comprehensive response - do not send multiple separate responses to the same query
- Wait for any running actions to complete before sending final response
- For AKT price queries, use only GET_TOKEN_INFO action and wait for completion before responding
```

### 3. Updated Style Guidelines

Added specific rules to prevent multiple responses:

```typescript
"SINGLE RESPONSE RULE: Wait for actions to complete, then provide ONE comprehensive response",
"NO DUPLICATE ACTIONS: Each query should trigger only one action type per request"
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed Duplicate Examples**: Eliminated conflicting message examples for AKT token queries
2. **Standardized Actions**: All AKT price queries now use `GET_TOKEN_INFO` consistently
3. **Clear Response Rules**: Added explicit instructions for single response behavior
4. **Action Completion**: Added guidance to wait for actions to complete before responding

## Expected Behavior After Fix

For AKT price queries, Navi should now:
1. Receive the query (e.g., "what's current AKT price?")
2. Trigger **only one** `GET_TOKEN_INFO` action
3. Wait for the action to complete
4. Provide **one comprehensive response** with the token information

## Testing

The fix has been validated through:
- ✅ Build compilation successful
- ✅ TypeScript validation passed
- ✅ Character configuration validated
- ✅ No syntax errors or conflicts

## Implementation Notes

- The changes maintain all existing functionality while eliminating duplicate responses
- All AKT-related queries now follow a consistent response pattern
- The fix preserves the ability to handle both simple price queries and detailed token information requests
- No breaking changes to the existing plugin architecture

## Follow-up Monitoring

Monitor Discord interactions to ensure:
- Single responses to AKT price queries
- Consistent action triggering
- No regression in other query types
- Maintained response quality and accuracy
